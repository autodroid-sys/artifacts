question: "\nYour answer should always use the following format: { \"Steps\": \"...<steps usually involved to complete the above task on a smartphone>\", \"Analyses\": \"...<Analyses of the relations between the task, and relations between the previous UI actions and current UI state>\", \"Finished\": \"Yes/No\", \"Next step\": \"None or a <high level description of the next step>\", \"id\": \"an integer or -1 (if the task has been completed by previous UI actions)\", \"action\": \"tap or input\", \"input_text\": \"N/A or ...<input text>\" } \n\n**Note that the id is the id number of the UI element to interact with. If you think the task has been completed by previous UI actions, the id should be -1. If 'Finished' is 'Yes', then the 'description' of 'Next step' is 'None', otherwise it is a high level description of the next step. If the 'action' is 'tap', the 'input_text' is N/A, otherwise it is the '<input text>'. Please do not output any content other than the JSON format. **"
