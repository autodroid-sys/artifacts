    <p id=1>How can I change lap sorting at the stopwatch tab?</p>

    <p id=2>Just click on any of the columns, that will make the laps be sorted by
    the given column. With additional clicks you can toggle between ascending and
    descending sorting.</p>

    <p id=3>How come I don''t see this apps widget on the list of widgets?</p>

    <p id=4>It is most likely because you moved the app on an SD card. There is an
    Android system limitation which hides the given app widgets in that case. The
    only solution is to move the app back onto the Internal Storage via your device
    settings.</p>

    <p id=5>I don''t like the widget colors, can I change them?</p>

    <p id=6>Yep, as you drag a widget on your home screen a widget config screen appears.
    You will see colored squares at the bottom left corner, just press them to pick
    a new color. You can use the slider for adjusting the alpha too.</p>

    <p id=7>How can I select multiple items at once?</p>

    <p id=8>There are multiple ways of doing that. The first one is starting the selection
    mode by long pressing one item, then short clicking on others to select them.
    The second way is similar to selecting items on PCs with a mouse, just start the
    selection mode by long pressing one item, then with your finger still down drag
    it across other items for selecting. The third way of selecting multiple items
    is long pressing one item, then long pressing another one and everything in between
    gets selected. If you want to select all items, just long press one item, then
    click at the selected item counter at the top left corner. That will select or
    unselect all everything.</p>

    <p id=10>I want to support you, but I cannot donate money. Is there anything else
    I can do?</p>

    <p id=11>Yes, of course. You can spread the word about the apps or give good feedback
    and ratings. You can also help by translating the apps in a new language, or just
    update some existing translations. The guide to translating is at this website,
    or just contact us at hello@simplemobiletools.com if you have any questions. </p>

    <p id=12>The app launcher icon disappeared. What can I do?</p>

    <p id=13>It is caused by your launcher not supporting icon customization properly.
    Try launching the app via Google Play or some widget, if available. Once launched,
    just set back the default orange icon #F57C00. You might have to reinstall the
    app in the worst case.</p>'
