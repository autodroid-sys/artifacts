The only solution is to move the app back onto the Internal Storage via your device settings.</p>\n<p id=5>I don't like the widget colors, can I change them?</p>\n<p id=6>Yep, as you drag a widget on your home screen a widget config screen appears. You will see colored squares at the bottom left corner, just press them to pick a new color. You can use the slider for adjusting the alpha too.</p>\n<p id=7>How can I select multiple items at once?</p>\n<p id=8>There are multiple ways of doing that. The first one is starting the selection mode by long pressing one item, then short clicking on others to select them. The second way is similar to selecting items on PCs with a mouse, just start the selection mode by long pressing one item, then with your finger still down drag it across other items for selecting. The third way of selecting multiple items is long pressing one item, then long pressing another one and everything in between gets selected. If you want to select all items, just long press one item, then click at the selected item counter at the top left corner. That will select or unselect all everything.</p>\n<button id=9>go back</button>\n<p id=10>I want to support you, but I cannot donate money. Is there anything else I can do?</p>\n<p id=11>Yes, of course. You can spread the word about the apps or give good feedback and ratings. You can also help by translating the apps in a new language, or just update some existing translations. The guide to translating is at this website, or just contact us at hello@simplemobiletools.com if you have any questions. </p>\n<p id=12>The app launcher icon disappeared. What can I do?</p>\n<p id=13>It is caused by your launcher not supporting icon customization properly. Try launching the app via Google Play or some widget, if available. Once launched, just set back the default orange icon #F57C00. You might have to reinstall the app in the worst case.</p>\nYour answer should always use the following format: { \"Steps\": \"...<steps usually involved to complete the above task on a smartphone>\", \"Analyses\": \"...<Analyses of the relations between the task, and relations between the previous UI actions and current UI state>\", \"Finished\": \"Yes/No\", \"Next step\": \"None or a <high level description of the next step>\", \"id\": \"an integer or -1 (if the task has been completed by previous UI actions)\", \"action\": \"tap or input\", \"input_text\": \"N/A or ...<input text>\" } \n\n**Note that the id is the id number of the UI element to interact with.
