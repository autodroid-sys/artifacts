While you use your device it is no longer possible to fully hide the notifications of apps like this. If you check the proper setting item, the app will do its best to hide it. You can hide it on the lockscreen though, if you disable the displaying of sensitive notifications in your device settings.</p>\n <p id=3>How can I select multiple items at once?</p>\n <p id=4>There are multiple ways of doing that. The first one is starting the selection mode by long pressing one item, then short clicking on others to select them. The second way is similar to selecting items on PCs with a mouse, just start the selection mode by long pressing one item, then with your finger still down drag it across other items for selecting. The third way of selecting multiple items is long pressing one item, then long pressing another one and everything in between gets selected. If you want to select all items, just long press one item, then click at the selected item counter at the top left corner. That will select or unselect all everything.</p>\n <button id=5>go back</button>\nYour answer should always use the following format:\n1.
